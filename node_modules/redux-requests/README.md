redux-requests [![Version][npm-image]][npm-url]
===================

Manages in-flight requests with a [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux) [reducer](https://gaearon.github.io/redux/docs/basics/Reducers.html) - avoid issuing duplicate requests without any special logic!

`npm install --save redux-requests`

**[Live Example!](https://idolize.github.io/redux-requests)**

## Avoiding the issue of multiple requests

Say your application has two views for the same set of data, and this data has not yet been fetched. A naïve approach to fetch this data would be to trigger an [Action Creator](https://gaearon.github.io/redux/docs/basics/Actions.html), which fetches the data from an HTTP API endpoint, in both of the views as soon as they render (`componentWillMount` in React terms).

The problem with this approach is that **you end up with two identical HTTP requests when you only need one**! You waste bandwidth doing this, and you may also waste render cycles as the [Store](https://gaearon.github.io/redux/docs/basics/Store.html) updates twice as a result of handling both identical responses.

### How can we fix this?

You could wrap all your calls to fetch the data with `if` statements, and keep track of that state somewhere, but who wants to do that by hand?

### Enter: redux-requests

This library will not only keep track of all pending requests for you, but also provide a convenient [middleware](https://gaearon.github.io/redux/docs/api/applyMiddleware.html) function that will avoid dispatching Actions to request data if there is already a pending HTTP request for this data in flight!

As a result, you can use the *very same naïve approach outlined earlier with hardly any code changes* and it will "just work"! Keep your views stateless and your Reducers ignorant of the notion of "pending requests"!

## Simple example

Just specify a function that makes the request (should return a `Promise`), Action objects to dispatch depending on the outcome of the request, and register the `createRequestMiddleware` middleware and the `requestsReducer` reducer as part of your Redux configuration. That's it.

```js
import { attemptRequest, requestsReducer, createRequestMiddleware } from 'redux-requests';
// Attempt to make a request if there isn't one for this URL already
function loadRepos(userId) {
  // Using redux-thunk middleware here, but other options should work as well
  return function (dispatch, getState) {
    const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${userId}/repos`;

    attemptRequest(url, {
      begin: () => ({
        type: 'LOAD_REPOS',
        payload: {
          userId
        }
      }),
      success: response => ({
        type: 'LOAD_REPOS',
        payload: {
          userId,
          response
        }
      }),
      failure: error => ({
        type: 'LOAD_REPOS',
        error,
        payload: {
          userId
        }
      })
    }, () => fetch(url)
      .then(checkStatus)
      .then(parseJSON)
    , dispatch);
  }
}
// Add additional reducer and middleware
const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware, createRequestMiddleware())(createStore);
let store = createStoreWithMiddleware(combineReducers({ requestsReducer, githubRepos }));
```

## What's going on: before and after

The `attemptRequest` function is actually just a simple helper (and is completely optional). All it does is:

1. Add `meta.httpRequest` fields to your Action objects
  - `meta.httpRequest.url` is required, and will be used as the unique identifier for the request
  - `meta.httpRequest.done` is a boolean indiecating if this action corresponds to a beginning or ending part of the request sequence
    - Typically a successful response Action and a failed response Action will both have `meta.httpRequest.done = true`
2. Check if the `dispatch` for your initial request Action was cancelled (`dispatch` will return `undefined`), and if so, prevent issuing the request

#### Original, naïve code (without redux-requests library):

```js
// React component
class Repos extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  componentWillMount() {
    // Action Creator attempts to request data for this user
    this.props.loadRepos(this.props.username);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { this.props.repos }
      </div>
    );
  }
}

function mapStateToProps(state)  {
  return {
    repos: state.githubRepos
  };
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return {
    loadRepos: (userId) => { dispatch(loadRepos(userId)); }
  };
}

export const ReposComponent = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Repos);

// Action Creator
export function loadRepos(userId) {
  return function (dispatch, getState) {
    const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${userId}/repos`;

    dispatch({
      type: 'LOAD_REPOS',
      payload: {
        userId
      }
    });

    fetch(url)
      .then(response => dispatch({
        type: 'LOAD_REPOS',
        payload: {
          userId,
          response
        }
      }))
      .catch(error => dispatch({
        type: 'LOAD_REPOS',
        error: true,
        payload: {
          userId,
          error
        }
      })
    );
  }
}

// Store
const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware)(createStore);
let store = createStoreWithMiddleware(combineReducers({ githubRepos }));
```

#### New code (using redux-requests to manage pending requests):

```js
// React component stays exactly the same!

// Action Creator changes slightly
export function loadRepos(userId) {
  return function (dispatch, getState) {
    const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${userId}/repos`;

    if (!dispatch({
      type: 'LOAD_REPOS',
      payload: {
        userId
      },
      meta: {
        // Add metadata to the action
        httpRequest: { url, done: false }
      }
    })) {
      return; // bail out here if the middleware cancelled the dispatch
    }

    fetch(url)
      .then(response => dispatch({
        type: 'LOAD_REPOS',
        payload: {
          userId,
          response
        },
        meta: {
          // Add metadata to the action
          httpRequest: { url, done: true }
        }
      }))
      .catch(error => dispatch({
        type: 'LOAD_REPOS',
        error: true,
        payload: {
          userId,
          error
        },
        meta: {
          // Add metadata to the action
          httpRequest: { url, done: true }
        }
      })
    );
  }
}

// Add additional reducer and middleware
import { requestsReducer, createRequestMiddleware } from 'redux-requests';
const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware, createRequestMiddleware())(createStore);
let store = createStoreWithMiddleware(combineReducers({ requestsReducer, githubRepos }));
```

## API

### `requestsReducer(state, action)`

A reducer that keeps track of pending request state. It only operates on actions containing the `meta.httpRequest` field.

### `createRequestMiddleware(stateSelectorFunction)`

Returns a middleware function to pass to `applyMiddleware`. Optionally pass a `stateSelectorFunction` which returns where the `requestsReducer` keeps its state in the Store (if not passed, will default to `state => state.requests`).

Ex: `applyMiddleware(createRequestMiddleware(state => state.pendingHttpRequests))(createStore)`

### `attemptRequest(url, actions, makeRequest, dispatch)`

Helper function to reduce boilerplate when issuing a request, while still allowing full control over the way in which the request is made/handled.

- `url` is the unique URL for this request.
- `actions` should be an object with `begin`, `success`, and `failure` methods; each of which return an Action object (but do not need to include the `meta.httpRequest` information, as that will be added automatically).
- `makeRequest` should return a `Promise` (how you make/handle the request is up to you).
- `dispatch` is function called when an Action is triggered (typically this will be the standard Redux store's `dispatch` method).
